# Xerxes
## Introduction
I decided to learn how to write Go a long time ago, but never got around to it. Finally came up with something to create and thought it would be nice in Go.

Query the Shodan API using Xerxes from the commandline, taking either single hostnames/IP addresses as input, or a file containing hostnames and IP addresses. Output to stdout or an output file.

Shodan is the evil AI in System Shock 2 hell-bent on destruction - Xerxes is her little AI lackey.

## Usage
